Tic-Tac-Toe

The goal of this project is to create a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game that can be played by two individuals (player X and player O) in front of the same computer (i.e. NOT over the Internet).

The Tic-Tac-Toe related functionality should be added to the "tictactoe" Django application (index view) and should make use of the Django forms library where possible (placeholder TicTacToeForm).

Bootstrap CSS is included in this project and should be used to layout the game board.
